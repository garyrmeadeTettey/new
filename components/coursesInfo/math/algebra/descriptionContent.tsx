      <p>
        Algebra introduces students to variables, algebraic expressions, equations, inequalities,
        functions, and all their multiple representations. In this class, students will develop the
        ability to explore and solve real-world application problems, demonstrate the appropriate
        use of graphing calculators, and communicate mathematical ideas clearly. This course lays
        the foundation for mathematical literacy that will help students be successful in every
        subsequent course in mathematics.
